We were given list of customers who made a purchase and didnot. Their data like country, language, salary were given and we have to prepare a model that accuractely predicts which customer is going to make a purchase and which is not

## Neural Network

Trained model is based on deep learning. Neurak networks used here is made from the very basic including cost, forward and back propogation adam. Their mathematical implementation is also done.

A keras based model is aldo trained just after this.
Both the model did great and performed well on the data.
